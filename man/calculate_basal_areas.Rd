\title{Calculate Basal Area from Tree Circumference}
\usage{
calculate_basal_areas(x, C130, C150)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data.frame containing tree inventory data.}

\item{C130}{Character. Name of the column storing circumference at 130 cm (in cm).}

\item{C150}{Character. Name of the column storing circumference at 150 cm (in cm).}
}
\value{
The input data.frame with one or both of the following columns added:
\itemize{
  \item \code{G130}: basal area based on \code{C130};
  \item \code{G150}: basal area based on \code{C150}.
}
Only columns not already present in the data are created. If the corresponding circumference column
is missing, the basal area is not computed.
}
\description{
Computes the basal area (in square meters) at breast height for each tree
using the circumference at 130 cm and/or 150 cm above ground. The formula used is:
\deqn{G = C^2 / (4 * pi * 10000)}
where \eqn{C} is the circumference in centimeters and \eqn{G} is the basal area in square meters.
}
\details{
The result is expressed in square meters per tree. The division by 10,000 converts from cm² to m².
The function is typically used in preprocessing steps before applying volume or biomass equations.
