\title{List available equation sources (with optional bibliography)}
\usage{
list_sources(ref = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{ref}{Logical, default `TRUE`. If `TRUE` and a `Reference` column exists,
include bibliography in the printed output and in the returned object.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns either:
- a **data frame** with columns `Source` and `Reference` (when `ref = TRUE`
  and a `Reference` column exists), or
- a **character vector** of unique sources (otherwise).
}
\description{
Prints and returns the set of unique sources found in `equations$Source_Eq`.
When `ref = TRUE` (default) **and** a `Reference` column is present, the
function also prints and returns the bibliographic reference(s) associated to
each source (collapsed if multiple).
}
\details{
- If `Reference` exists and there are multiple distinct references per
  `Source_Eq`, they are collapsed with `" | "`.
- If `Reference` is missing for some sources, `NA` is shown/returned for
  those entries.
- The printed output is numbered and ends with a total count line.
