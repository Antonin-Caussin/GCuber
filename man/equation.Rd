\title{Filter Equations by Type}
\usage{
equation(equation_type, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{equation_type}{Character string. Type of equation to filter for
(e.g., "V22", "biomass", "height"). Must match exactly the equation types
in the Y column of the database.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{carbofor_species()}}
}
\value{
Same as \code{carbofor_species()}
}
\description{
This function provides a convenient way to filter equations by type only.
It's a wrapper around \code{carbofor_species()} with the equation_type
parameter pre-specified.
}
\details{
This is a convenience function for users who want to explore all equations
of a specific type across all species. It's equivalent to calling
\code{carbofor_species(equation_type = equation_type, ...)}.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Get all V22 equations across all species
equation("V22")

# Get biomass equations without visual formatting
biomass_data <- equation("biomass", plot = FALSE)

# Equivalent to:
carbofor_species(equation_type = "V22")
carbofor_species(equation_type = "biomass", plot = FALSE)
}
